# Scaffolder UI Agent Instructions

## TypeScript checks (required)

- ALWAYS run a TypeScript typecheck before finishing any task that touches code in this directory.
- Use this command and include any relevant errors or confirmations in your response:
    - `pnpm run typecheck`

## Notes

- If typecheck fails, fix errors or ask for guidance before finalizing.
